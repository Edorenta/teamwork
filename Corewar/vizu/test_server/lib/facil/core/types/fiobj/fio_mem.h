/**
 * This is a custom memory allocator the utilizes memory pools to allow for
 * concurrent memory allocations across threads.
 *
 * Allocated memory is always zeroed out and aligned on a 16 byte boundary.
 *
 * Reallocated memory is always aligned on a 16 byte boundary but it might be
 * filled with junk data after the valid data (this is true also for
 * `fio_realloc2`).
 *
 * The memory allocator assumes multiple concurrent allocation/deallocation,
 * short life spans (memory is freed shortly, but not immediately, after it was
 * allocated) and we small allocations (realloc almost always copies data).
 *
 * These assumptions allow the allocator to avoid lock contention by ignoring
 * fragmentation within a memory "block" and waiting for the whole "block" to be
 * freed before it's memory is recycled (no "free list").
 *
 * This allocator should NOT be used for objects with a long life-span, because
 * even a single persistent object will prevent the re-use of the whole memory
 * block (128Kb by default) from which it was allocated.
 *
 * A memory "block" can include any number of memory pages that are a multiple
 * of 2 (up to 1Mb of memory). However, the default value, set by
 * MEMORY_BLOCK_SIZE, is either 128Kb (set at th end of this header).
 *
 * Each block includes a header that uses reference counters and position
 * markers.
 *
 * The position marker (`pos`) marks the next available byte (counted in
 * multiples of 16).
 *
 * The reference counter (`ref`) counts how many pointers reference memory in
 * the block (including the "arena" that "owns" the block).
 *
 * Except for the position marker (`pos`) that acts the same as `sbrk`, there's
 * no way to know which "slices" are allocated and which "slices" are available.
 *
 * Small allocations are differentiated by their memory alignment. If a memory
 * allocation is placed 8 bytes after whole block alignment, the memory was
 * allocated directly using `mmap` (and it might be using a whole page more than
 * request, just because it needed that extra header space!).
 *
 * The allocator uses `mmap` when requesting memory from the system and for
 * allocations bigger than MEMORY_BLOCK_ALLOC_LIMIT (37.5% of the block).
 *
 * To replace the system's `malloc` function family compile with the
 * `FIO_OVERRIDE_MALLOC` defined (`-DFIO_OVERRIDE_MALLOC`).
 *
 * When using tcmalloc or jemalloc, define `FIO_FORCE_MALLOC` to prevent
 * `fio_mem` from compiling (`-DFIO_FORCE_MALLOC`). Function wrappers will be
 * compiled just in case, so calls to `fio_malloc` will be routed to `malloc`.
